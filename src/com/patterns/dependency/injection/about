>>  Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object ( or static method ) supplies the dependencies
of another object . A dependency is an object that can be used ( a service )

>>  So transferring the task of creating the object to someone else
and directly using the dependency is called dependency injection

>> WHY D I ?
    Lets say we have a CAR a class which contains various objects such as Wheels,engine etc
    Here the class is responsible for creating all the dependency objects .
    Now what if i decide to ditch MRF wheels in future and go with YOKA wheels ??

    we will need to recreate the car object .
    but using DI we can change the wheels t runtime
    ( because dependencies can be injected at runtime rather than compile time)
